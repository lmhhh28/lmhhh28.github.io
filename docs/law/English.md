Good morning everyone, today I want to walk you through the overall framework for creating a cultural tourism video about Huanggang. The goal is to outline the key structural elements and narrative approach so it's might be a bit abstract and boring. But next ZhongTingyang will introduce some specific details about the video to you.

First, we start with a central theme that captures the essence of the city: "Huanggang: Where History Meets Natural Wonders". This theme speaks directly to our target audience, which includes cultural travelers, history enthusiasts, and nature lovers. It sets the stage for a story that blends the past, present, and future of this fascinating destination.

The video will be structured around six main dimensions to showcase local culture and characteristics. These dimensions serve as the backbone of our storytelling. We'll begin with Scholarly Legacy, moving on to Natural Splendor, Cultural Treasures, Culinary Journey, Modern Vitality, and finally ending with an Invitation & Call-to-Action. This sequence allows us to build a comprehensive portrait of Huanggang, from its intellectual heritage to its contemporary energy.

In terms of narrative logic, we'll follow a timeline that flows from past to present to future, connecting history, nature, and modernity. The historical segment will feature landmarks like Red Cliff and ancient art, while the present will highlight natural landscapes such as mountains, hot springs, and reservoirs. For the future, we'll focus on modern developments like high-speed rail, universities, and tech parks. This progression helps viewers understand how Huanggang's rich history continues to shape its present and future.

Each section of the video will rely on three key elements to engage the audience. Visual footage will bring each theme to life, from aerial shots of natural wonders to close-ups of cultural artifacts. A voice-over script will provide context and connect different ideas, guiding viewers through the story. Effects and music will enhance the emotional impact, with traditional instruments for historical segments and modern beats for contemporary scenes.

When it comes to putting the video together, smooth transitions between sections are essential. We can use visual metaphors or overlapping scenes to create a seamless flow. Pacing is another critical factor: we'll start with a catchy opening to grab attention, followed by a rich middle section that dives into the details, and end with an emotional conclusion that encourages action. Maintaining a consistent visual style that balances tradition and modernity will help reinforce the video's message.

Ultimately, the goal of this cultural tourism video is to create an emotional connection with viewers. By combining historical context, natural beauty, and modern innovation, we aim to position Huanggang as a dynamic and multifaceted destination. The hope is that this framework will serve as a blueprint to translate the city's unique essence into a compelling visual story that inspires people to explore all that Huanggang has to offer.

Thank you for listening, and now it's time for some details given by ZhongTingyang.
