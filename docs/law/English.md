Today I’d like to talk about the recent situation at Southwest University of Science and Technology. Under its “Double First-Class” initiative, the university introduced strict regulations for freshmen. (slide) including mandatory(命令的) morning self-study at 7:00 AM and unified(统一的) evening sessions until 8:40 PM, with a ban on mobile phone use during these periods. Additionally, students were prohibited from gaming in dormitories after evening study to ensure sufficient rest. Some students reported that they were caught playing games in their dormitories after evening self-study sessions and were subsequently punished by their counselors(辅导员).

However, these measures faced strong opposition from students. In response, the university clarified that there had been a miscommunication in the initial notice, revised(修订) the policy, and relaxed restrictions on electronic devices. This incident raises critical questions about the role of universities in managing students’ time and freedom.

From my viewpoint, universities undeniably(无疑地) have a responsibility to guide freshmen in developing disciplined habits, especially during the transition to independent college life. Structured schedules can help students adapt and prioritize academics.

However, overregulation risks undermining the core purpose of higher education: fostering self-discipline and critical thinking. Universities must strike a balance. While initial guidance is reasonable, prolonged(长期的) micromanagement(干涉)—such as confiscating(没收) devices or policing(管辖) dormitory activities—can infantilize(幼稚化) students and stifle(扼杀) their ability to manage time independently. True education should empower(使) students to take ownership(所有权) of their learning, not enforce rigid(只是强迫), high school-like controls.

Moreover, the school's measures appear to be a superficial effort for appearances. The sudden shift in the school's stance(姿态) and its conciliatory(和解) rhetoric(修辞) inevitably(不可避免地) raise suspicions that the strict management of students was merely a performance.

OK, now I’d like you to analyze this issue from university administrators’ perspective and students’ perspective.

From the perspective of university administrators :

- Should a university assume the role of an administrator, an educator, or are both roles essential?

- Under the current employment situation and academic pressure faced by university students, should university management adopt a more high school-like approach?

- Is the academic atmosphere in universities important? How can a balance be achieved between fostering a positive learning environment and excessively intervening in students' daily studies and lives?

From the perspective of students :

- Should learning be self-discipline or external discipline, or are both indispensable?

- In the current employment landscape and the pressure of further education, the evaluation system in universities is becoming increasingly homogenized. Realistically speaking, do you think college students should focus more on diversified development or engage in the rat race to achieve higher GPAs and scores for greater advantages in advancing their education?

In university, it is not only about acquiring knowledge and skills, but also about cultivating good habits and the ability to learn. As students, the former can be guided and supervised by the university’s management system, while the latter can only be achieved through our own efforts.

In conclusion, we may mean university administrators should maintain a dynamic balance between self-discipline and external discipline rather than resorting solely to strict control over students.
